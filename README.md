## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Commands

QuickDJS comes with a set of pre-built commands to get you started:

| Command       | Category      | Description                          |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `!ping`       | Utility       | Check the bot's latency.             |
| `!help`       | Information   | Displays a list of available commands. |
| `!info`       | Information   | Shows detailed information about the bot. |
| `!invite`     | Information   | Get the bot's invite link.           |
| `!ban`        | Moderation    | Ban a user from the server.          |

### Adding Custom Commands

To add a new command:
1. Create a new `.js` file in the appropriate category folder under `commands/` (e.g., `commands/utility/mycommand.js`).
2. Follow the structure below:

```js
module.exports = {
    name: 'mycommand',
    description: 'This is my custom command.',
    category: 'Utility',
    execute(message, args) {
        message.channel.send('Hello from my custom command!');
    },
};
```

3. Restart the bot, and your command will be automatically loaded.

## üé® Stylish Logging

QuickDJS uses the `chalk` library to style logs in the terminal. Logs are categorized and color-coded for better readability:

- **Info Logs**: `[INFO]` in green.
- **Success Logs**: `[SUCCESS]` in blue.
- **Error Logs**: `[ERROR]` in red.

Example:
```
[12:34:56] [INFO] | Welcome to QuickDJS
[12:34:57] [SUCCESS] | Bot is online and ready!
```
